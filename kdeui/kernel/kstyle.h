/**
 * Makes style coding more convenient.
 *
 * @todo and allows to style KDE specific widgets.
 *
 * KStyle strives to ease style development by implementing various QStyle
 * methods. These implementations are based on
 * -# the concept of Layout Properties. These properties can be set using
 *    setWidgetLayoutProp(). KStyle uses this information to respect various
 *    metrics (like space between primitives or margins around widget contents)
 *    or turn specific features on or off.
 * -# the concept of KStyle Primitives. These can be implemented by overriding
 *    drawKStylePrimitive() and providing drawing methods for specific
 *    primitives. Often, the drawing of more complex widgets consists of
 *    several primitives.

     * Naming convention: "appname.(2-char-element-type)_element"

     * @returns a unique id for the @p element string or 0, if the element is not supported by the

     * Important notes:
     * 1) If your string lacks the matching "SH_", "CE_" or "SE_" token the element
     * request will be ignored (return is 0)
     * 2) Try to avoid custom elements and use default ones (if possible) to get better style support
     * and keep UI coherency
     * 3) If you cache this value (good idea, this requires a map lookup) don't (!) forget to catch
     * style changes in QWidget::changeEvent()
