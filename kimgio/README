This directory contains Katie imageformat plugins. See Katie docs for
writing a new handler.

Current formats include:

WEBP    <read> <write>
RAW     <read>
JPEG    <read>
JP2     <read>
ICO     <read>

along with whatever ImageMagick supports but it is assumed that it supports
reading atleast the following formats (even if they cannot be loaded because
it was build without support for these formats for example) for compatibility:

PGM     <read>
XBM     <read>
GIF     <read>

If you want to contribute plugin for image format and there is no solid
C/C++ library for it (like there is for WebP) then it is unlikely it will be
accepted.
