This directory contains Katie imageformat plugins. See Katie docs for
writing a new handler.

Current formats include:

WEBP    <read> <write>
JPEG    <read> <write>
ICO     <read> <write>
JP2     <read>
RAW     <read>

If you want to contribute plugin for image format and there is no solid
C/C++ library for it (like there is for WebP) then it is unlikely it will be
accepted.
