* Proper support for KWebKitPart in the following Konqueror plugins:
      - adblock    This plugin's GUI needs to be changed to use the KPart plugin
                   extensions so that it is not khtml specific. Other than that
                   kwebkitpart supports the ad filtering functionalities supported
                   by khtml.

* Add KPartStatusBarExtension support for the following plugins/features:
      - Popup blocker (non-plugin)

* Implement some means of showing information about the webkit rendering engine:
      - KWebKitPart's version #
      - QtWebKit's version #
      - UserAgent string ???

* Look through all of Konqueror's web configuration options and make sure we
  honor all those we possibly can. Here is a non-complete list of features
  that are either partially implemented or not implemented at all:
      - Change cursor over links (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Smooth scrolling support (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Underline links support (Partial, does not work as intended).
      - Enable access key navigation with Ctrl key (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Animations (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Draw frames around not completely loaded images (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
