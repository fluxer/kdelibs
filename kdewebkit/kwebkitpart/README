How to use KWebKitPart in Konqueror
===================================

You can switch between the different rendering engines:
View -> View Mode -> {KHTML, WebKit} (website needs to be open)
If WebKit does not show up in Konqueror, run 'kbuildsycoca4' and
restart Konqueror. Note that this change does not persist. If you
press the reload button or open a new website, it will fall back
to the default rendering engine. 

If you want to set KWebKitPart as default for any website, run:
'keditfiletype text/html'
and move "WebKit (kwebkitpart)" in the "Embedding" tab to the top.

In KDE 4.6 and higher you can choose the default rendering engine
in Konqueror's configuration dialog under the "General" section.
