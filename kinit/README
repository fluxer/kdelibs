klauncher is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used for
booting UNIX.

It performs two tasks:
 - start programs ment to be started when the session is (XDG autostart)
 - start programs on menu, panel launcher request, etc.

Application startup notification is also a feature it takes care of with
updates being send as the program state changes.
